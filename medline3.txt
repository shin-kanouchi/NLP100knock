Acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
(ARDS)
and
acute
lung
injury
(ALI)
are
conditions
associated
with
an
estimated
mortality
of
40–50%
.
The
use
of
inhaled
vasodilators
can
help
to
improve
oxygenation
without
hemodynamic
effects
.
This
article
reviews
relevant
studies
addressing
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
inhaled
nitric
oxide
(iNO)
and
aerosolized
epoprostenol
(aEPO)
in
the
treatment
of
life-threatening
hypoxemia
associated
with
ARDS
and
ALI
.
In
addition
,
the
article
also
provides
a
practicable
guide
to
the
clinical
application
of
these
therapies
.
Nine
prospective
randomized
controlled
trials
were
included
for
iNO
reporting
on
changes
in
oxygenation
or
clinical
outcomes
.
Seven
reports
of
aEPO
were
examined
for
changes
in
oxygenation
.
Based
on
currently
available
data
,
the
use
of
either
iNO
or
aEPO
is
safe
to
use
in
patients
with
ALI
or
ARDS
to
transiently
improve
oxygenation
.
No
differences
have
been
observed
in
survival
,
ventilator-free
days
,
or
attenuation
in
disease
severity
.
Further
studies
with
consistent
end
points
using
standard
delivery
devices
and
standard
modes
of
mechanical
ventilation
are
needed
to
determine
the
overall
benefit
with
iNO
or
aEPO
.
